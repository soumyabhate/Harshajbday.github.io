	<strong><p align='justify'><b>Harshaj Singh Parihar</b> (born <em>28 January 2002</em>...<u>surprisingly hum sabse chota 
hai</u>) is grown-up in the farms (sugarcane) of Balaghat. Balaghat is famous for natural resourses like Manganese, Copper and 
<em>Reproducing</em> antique humans like <b>"Ms. Harshaj"</b>. He got his ass kicked from <b>St. Mary's School</b>, Balaghat as soon as he completed 
his <em>10th</em> and accomplished his further <em>laumdiya-baazi</em> from Balaghat <mark>English</mark> Higher Secondary School. He used to carry a bale of 
tiffin and water bottle which got him famous with a nickname <b>"Potli"</b> in his school days. In his <mark>pre-adolescence</mark> age, he created 
a fake Instagram Account naming <b>Ananya Tripathi</b> referring as his <em>Online Girlfriend</em> among his friend circle to gain popularity, but 
this scam came to a drastic end giving him inspiration to improve his lying and stalking skills.</p>
	<p align='justify'>He is generally known as <b>"Master Stalker"</b>. This name defines his <mark>observational skills</mark> in online social 
media world (agar izzatdaar language me likha jaye toh). Justifying his name (Master Stalker) he is also known for his information handling skills 
as he's always updated about everyone's life and being a <mark>"Master"</mark> his personal life remains anonymous. He also gained reputation for his 
Relationship Advisory skills in late <em>2020s</em>. In <em>2019</em>, he became a trend in his University due of the fact that he owns an <mark>OYO 
Gold</mark> subscription. People usually call him <b>"OYO Mafia"</b>. He also tried his hands on poetry and blogs (normal heart-rending stuff) after 
going through a <mark>routine breakup</mark>.</p>
